==TargetStore==

This program is a Target Function. This function can be used as a register for your products or items
you would like to enter. What this program does is to correctly emulate a Target register as if it is the real thing.
This is by converting and transferring the digits you may enter into passing the function.
First, All you need to do is enter a name, and make sure that name does not contain any character that isn't a letter.
After this is done, the code will ask you for your item name. Make sure the item name is not a number,
as the specific variable is only coded to convert string. Third, it will ask you to enter the price of your item.
Make sure it is a number or decimal. Once it prints out your item price, it will ask you for a coupon.
Type 'y' or 'n', otherwise, the function will not know what you are telling it to do.
Once this is done, the register will print out your final product or ask you for confirmation depending on the answer.
If it asks you for verification, please type y or n. if you say 'y' it will give you the final product.
If you type 'n' it will give you a goodbye message, showing that your shopping is complete.
